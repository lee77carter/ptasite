											<h2>Volunteer Committees</h2>
											<h3>Proctor PTA needs you ...</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Our organization could not exist without the wonderful support of family volunteers and generous donations throughout the year.  Every one of our programs, from fundraising to community-building events, to classroom enrichment experiences, requires a committee of dedicated volunteers. Contributing just a few hours a year in the classroom or at a single event is more valuable than you could imagineâ€”we need and appreciate all of our volunteers! We invite you to join Proctor PTA and make a difference by attending our general Association Meetings and PTA-sponsored events and projects.  By working together, we can make Proctor School the best it can be! </p>									
										<p>Please check the list to see where your skills and interests are best matched. Thank you for supporting your PTA with your valuable time and commitment.
